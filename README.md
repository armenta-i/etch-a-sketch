# Etch-A-Sketch
This project is a simple Etch-A-Sketch application created for learning purposes. It allows users to draw on a grid by hovering over the squares with different colors. The goal of this project was to improve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, etc.

## Features
- Drawing Modes: Users can choose any color they want, or they can opt for a random color mode that changes the color to a random generated color.
- Adjustable Size Grid: The grid can be resized to accomodate different number of squares.
- Reset Functionality: A button to clear the entire board and have a fresh board.
